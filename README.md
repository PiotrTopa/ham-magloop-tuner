# ham-magloop-tuner
Small magnetic loop antenna tuner.

Quick and dirty implementation of remote tuning for MagLoop capacitor.

- HTTP server
- Bootstrap + jQuery frontend served from spiffs file
- Backend API (restFUL... a bit)
- PWM + ON/OFF timers for precise brush motor controll (old Tower 9g servo)
